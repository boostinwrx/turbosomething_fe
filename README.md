# *Powah!* Front-end


#### *Powah!* is a S.P.A. web-app built using 100% vanilla JavaScript on the client-side (this repo), and Ruby on Rails (w/ PostgreSQL) for the server-side API

**[Link to Rails server-side repo](https://github.com/boostinwrx/turbosomething_be)**


This concept was created as our Flatiron School Mod 4 project, with my project partner [Will Comfort](https://github.com/wcomfortI).

---
#### Application still in development, currently polishing up and building upon original concept

#### Check back soon to see the new and improved *Powah!* .
